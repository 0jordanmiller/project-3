Hidden Talents

Why is Hidden Talents an important application? It is solving a problem for professionals who have extra time 

and would like to earn extra money while doing something they enjoy. 

Hidden Talents is a local forum of Etsy combined with Angie's List and Upwork. It allows people to showcase their 

talents locally and allows users to find local talent in areas of need: web development, home improvement, or 

tutoring. 

Imagine a professional who has a serious or mundane job, but that person loves to do interior design and they're 

really good at it. They've done it for their friends and family. They've always wanted to try to make a little 

extra cash doing it, but have never figured out how Hidden Talent allows individuals to showcase their unique skills 

in a way that is controlled by both users. This application will allow that professional to exhibit a portfolio of 

their skills to people (individuals and/or businesses) looking for a talent that won't break the bank.
